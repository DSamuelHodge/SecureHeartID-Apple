- User Interface: UIKit
- Machine Learning: CoreML, coremltools
- Data Storage: Keychain, UserDefaults
- Testing: XCTest framework, XCUITest

## Key Milestones
1. Project kickoff and architecture finalization
2. Successful ECG data capture and model conversion
3. Completion of secure template generation and storage
4. Implementation of identity verification process
5. User interface development and integration
6. Continuous learning system implementation
7. App submission for testing and store approval

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies
1. **Risk**: Delays in PyTorch to CoreML model conversion
   **Mitigation**: Allocate buffer time and consider involving ML specialists if needed

2. **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in biometric data handling
   **Mitigation**: Regular security audits and adherence to Apple's security guidelines

3. **Risk**: Performance issues on older Apple Watch models
   **Mitigation**: Continuous performance testing and optimization

4. **Risk**: Regulatory compliance challenges
   **Mitigation**: Early engagement with legal team and staying updated on relevant regulations

## Next Steps
1. Confirm project start date and adjust timeline accordingly
2. Assemble the project team and assign roles
3. Set up development environment and necessary tools
4. Schedule kick-off meeting with all stakeholders
5. Begin Phase 1 of the project

## Regular Check-ins
- Daily stand-ups with the development team
- Weekly progress reports to stakeholders
- Bi-weekly demo sessions to showcase completed features

This project plan is subject to change based on stakeholder feedback and unforeseen challenges. Regular updates will be provided throughout the project lifecycle.
